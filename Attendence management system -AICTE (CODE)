The Attendance Management System utilizes Python’s csv and datetime modules to efficiently manage attendance records.
It stores data in a file named attendance.csv, where the mark_attendance function records the user’s name and timestamp, and the view_attendance function retrieves and displays the data in a formatted table.
The program features a user-friendly, menu-driven interface, enabling users to mark attendance, view records, or exit the system. With built-in error handling and a modular design, the system is scalable and can be enhanced with advanced features like biometric authentication or cloud integration, making it a reliable and adaptable solution for attendance management.
